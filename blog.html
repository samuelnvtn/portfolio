        <i>23.10.2025</i>
        <p>
            I was reflecting on my life today and I came to a conclusion I could start my own personal blog to document my thoughts, projects and
            basically anything that crosses my chaotic mind. So here goes nothing! I chose this rather minimalistic design, which is also inspired by
            DedSec from Watch Dogs 2, because I simply like it and want to keep this as simplistic as possible, after all my thoughts are the primary
            thing on here.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the course of next few days/weeks, I would like to<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/touch.1.html">touch</a>some subjects
            like my IT student and developer journey, my current <i>lost in life</i> status or my <i>"productivity stack"</i>.
